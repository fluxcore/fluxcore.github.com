What is FluxCore?
-

**FluxCore** is an application framework for PHP made for those that are
looking for a framework but without all the extra "fuss".

It is meant to be used as an absolute base for you to implement
features as you see fit and everything on the application end is easily
accessible for modifications.

It can also be thought of as a more lightweight alternative to **Laravel 4**
as **FluxCore** has full Illuminate compatibility.  
What differentiates **FluxCore** from **Laravel 4** however is that all components
are completely decoupled from the framework giving you complete control of all aspects
of the framework.

Where do I start?
-

Getting started with **FluxCore** is really simple, you can read more about it [here](#/docs/guide/getting-started).
